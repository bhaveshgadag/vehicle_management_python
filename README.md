Vehicle Service Management System using Python 3.6.6, PyQt5, MySQL and ReportLab.

The proposed Vehicle Service Center management system is developed for maintaining
the service center activities like, car maintenance, customer bill generation, car service and
spare parts sales, employee details, to improve accuracy and enhance the efficiency of service
center to better serve the customer. 

This system helps the end-user to maintain record of car
and it’s servicing. This system helps to maintain detailed information of customers. Through
this system we maintain the details of customers who bring their car in the service center. 
To keep track of previous services performed on the car by their service center, keep track of
spare parts used in service, generate bill for customer. 

Store records of employees and assign
a service-adviser to car. Search for available spare parts in the stockroom. This system helps
the user to search for an entry which is related to customer and easily get data with
description of model. 

Through this system we can easily maintain customer record and
servicing details of all customer with time period. And we efficiently maintain servicing
records. 

In this system we use Python as Front-end and MySQL as back-end.
